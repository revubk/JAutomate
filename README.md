## 📌 About

This project demonstrates automation skills including:
- Page object modeling using JSONs
- Navigations and Error validations
- Test structure and assertions
- Headless browser handling
- CI/CD readiness
=======
## 🌟 Key Skills Demonstrated

1. Framework Architecture

✔ Custom Helper LayersAction Layer: 

- ActionsHelper.js (Reusable interactions)
- Validation Layer: ValidationHelper.js (Smart assertions)
- Capture Layer: CaptureHelper.js (Data extraction)

✔ Dynamic Resource Loading

- Externalized locators in *.json
- Config management via config.json

✔ Cross-Test Type Support

- UI Tests: Full POM implementation
>>>>>>> Stashed changes

- API Tests: Shared auth tokens (see UpdateBooking.test.js)


3. Scalability Features

✔ Test Data Management

```json
// Data-driven testing
"username": "performance_glitch_user",
"password": "secret_sauce" 

<<<<<<< Updated upstream
## 🧪 How to Run Tests  Generate HTML report
```bash
npx playwright test
```

## 📊 Generate HTML report
```bash
npx playwright test --reporter=html
```
=======
```

✔ CI/CD Ready

- Parallel execution config

- HTML reporting pipeline

## 📈 What Makes This Professional-Grade?

- For SDET Roles
✅ Proves ability to build maintainable frameworks (not just write tests)
✅ Shows understanding of test architecture patterns
✅ Demonstrates CI/CD integration skills

- For Automation Engineers
✅ Externalized test data/locators for easy maintenance
✅ Reusable component design
✅ Production-ready error handling

---

## 🚀 How to Experience the Framework

# Run the demo suite
```bash
npm install
npm test
```

### Key Files to Review:

- ValidationHelper.js (Custom assertion logic)

- ProductsPage.test.js (UI test example)

- UpdateBooking.test.js (API test example)

## 📌 Why This Stands Out

Unlike basic automation scripts, this project showcases:
🔹 Strategic Thinking: Layered architecture for long-term maintenance
🔹 Technical Depth: Advanced Playwright features implemented correctly
🔹 Business Alignment: CI/CD integration shows DevOps awareness

Let's discuss how these skills can benefit your team!
