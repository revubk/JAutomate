## ðŸŒŸ Key Skills Demonstrated

### 1. Framework Architecture

âœ” Custom Helper Layers

- Action Layer: ActionsHelper.js (Reusable interactions)
- Validation Layer: ValidationHelper.js (Smart assertions)
- Capture Layer: CaptureHelper.js (Data extraction)

âœ” Dynamic Resource Loading

- Externalized locators in *.json
- Config management via config.json

âœ” Cross-Test Type Support

- UI Tests: Full POM implementation
- API Tests: Shared auth tokens (see UpdateBooking.test.js)


### 2. Scalability Features

âœ” Test Data Management

```json

// Data-driven testing
"username": "performance_glitch_user",
"password": "secret_sauce" 

```

âœ” CI/CD Ready

- Parallel execution config
- HTML reporting pipeline

---

## ðŸ“ˆ What Makes This Professional-Grade?

- For SDET Roles
âœ… Proves ability to build maintainable frameworks (not just write tests)
âœ… Shows understanding of test architecture patterns
âœ… Demonstrates CI/CD integration skills

- For Automation Engineers
âœ… Externalized test data/locators for easy maintenance
âœ… Reusable component design
âœ… Production-ready error handling

---

## ðŸš€ How to Experience the Framework

### Run the demo suite

```bash

npm install
npm run test
npm run generate-report

```

### Key Files to Review:

- ValidationHelper.js (Custom assertion logic)
- ProductsPage.test.js (UI test example)
- UpdateBooking.test.js (API test example)

## ðŸ“Œ Why This Stands Out

Unlike basic automation scripts, this project showcases:

ðŸ”¹ Strategic Thinking: Layered architecture for long-term maintenance
ðŸ”¹ Technical Depth: Advanced Playwright features implemented correctly
ðŸ”¹ Business Alignment: CI/CD integration shows DevOps awareness

Let's discuss how these skills can benefit your team!
